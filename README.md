### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Marcelo Veintimilla. I am a Software Engineering Technician, and I enjoy programming in Java. My aspiration in programming with Java lies in its Platform Independence, Strong Ecosystem, and Security features. These qualities have motivated me to explore Java further and see the extent of what I can achieve with it. While I primarily enjoy programming in Java, I also like to explore other programming languages such as Python, C, and C++. I find great pleasure in the art of programming. 

Keep Programming!
